        <h2>Who am I</h2>
        <p>My name is Jeremy Michael Beckelheimer and I am a professional machinest. I was born on January 3, 1982 in Springboro, Ohio and I am currently living in Las Vegas, Nevada. I moved to Vegas in September of 1999 and have been there ever since. I have two wonderful children named Ally and Austin and 1 step child named Ethan.</p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>I used to be in the Nightclub Industry as I worked at Drais from 2000 - 2004. I then transitioned into what I do now which is a CNC Machine Operator. I started this career off as a Printing Press Operator at Quality Impresions Printing and then went into CNC Lathes and Mills when I was hired at Power Gen Components. I then went to the company Vegas Fasteners MFG where I was doing all of the same jobs as at Power Gen Components but I was able to further learn about the industry there. I am currently employed and Ramsey and Sons Corporation doing various jobs such as running the Lazer Cutter, Punch Presses, Water Jets, etc.
